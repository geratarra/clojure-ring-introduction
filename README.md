## About this repository
---
While reading about Hypermedia Systems at https://hypermedia.systems, I thought, why not try the exercises from the book in Clojure? And here it is.
This is a Contacts app I'm using to follow up on exercises from the book and learn about Clojure, Ring, and HTMX.
Since this is just for learning purposes, you won't find any (at least not yet) installation steps, dev vs prod mode, database services, CI/CD stuff, etc.
